After downloading this repo the first thing to do is to install node modules. We have two separate installs to do i.e the frontend and the backend server.

To faciliate this process all you need to do is to run a npm command that is preset in the package.

`npm run module:install`

This command will install both frontend and backend for you, hence all that remains after is to run the server by running the below command.

`npm start`

This will run two separate commands and start both the backend server and the frontend server.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to start using the app.
